//Instructions:
//According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.
//You have to do God's job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects (representing Adam and Eve). 
//The first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman. 
//Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes.
